<h1 align="center"> Restaurant Food Ordering System - FrontEnd </h3>

## üì∞ *Description*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the reataurant food ordering system front-end service. This service will use routing capabilities to build a single page application using the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework. The [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) library will be used to simplify the number of AJAX calls needed. Additionally, the [Bootstrap 5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) framework will be used to implement templates, typography, and extra functionality for HTML and CSS to create a responsive website with a professional look.
